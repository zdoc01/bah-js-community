Presentations from the Booz Allen Hamilton JS User Group meetups.

# Setup
Each presentation is split into two parts. The presentation documents/applications, and the examples used by each presenter to provide live demos of said presentations.

All material related to a given topic may be found in the corresponding presentations/{topic} and examples/{topic} directories (some presentations may not have live demo materials and will therefore not be found in "examples").
